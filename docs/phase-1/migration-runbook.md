# Phase 1 Migration Runbook

**What this does:** Adds the product dimension to the CHG Supabase schema, so the same database can host CHG and Deal Link under one account system (blueprint §05 + §12).

**Blast radius:** Medium. Additive for live columns; drops four unused tables. Rollback scripted, PITR as safety net.

**Estimated downtime:** None required. Migration is additive and takes < 10 seconds. Recommended to run during a low-traffic window anyway for safety.

**Who runs it:** Nicole pastes SQL into Supabase SQL editor. Claude provides the SQL and monitors output.

## Phase A — Rehearse on staging (no prod risk)

### Step A1 — Build pre-Phase-1 state on staging (no prod data copy)

We deliberately do NOT copy prod customer data to staging. Reasons:
- Staging is free-tier (weaker controls); copying PII doubles attack surface
- The migration's correctness depends on *schema shape*, not on specific customer rows
- Most production-grade teams avoid real-customer data in staging

Instead, we rebuild prod's pre-Phase-1 shape from the dev SQL files, then seed 3 fake accounts with varied plan tiers so backfill logic has something to exercise.

**In staging SQL editor (`cmlfnhzjfhuynzuleyxt`)**, paste and run these files in order:

1. [`apps/chg/scripts/schema.sql`](../../apps/chg/scripts/schema.sql) — base business tables
2. [`apps/chg/scripts/saas-migration.sql`](../../apps/chg/scripts/saas-migration.sql) — multi-tenant layer (accounts, roles, RLS)
3. [`apps/chg/scripts/construction-migration.sql`](../../apps/chg/scripts/construction-migration.sql) — units, master_phases, addendums
4. [`apps/chg/scripts/fix-trigger.sql`](../../apps/chg/scripts/fix-trigger.sql) — NULL-safety fix prod already has
5. [`apps/chg/scripts/phase-1-staging-seed.sql`](../../apps/chg/scripts/phase-1-staging-seed.sql) — 3 fake accounts + roles + data

Each file should run in <5s and return "Success. No rows returned." If any file errors, STOP and paste the error to Claude.

After step 5, run the sanity check query from the bottom of the seed file:
- accounts: 3
- roles: 5
- role_permissions: 18
- properties: 4
- contractors: 2
- construction_projects: 2

### Step A2 — Apply the migration on staging

In **staging** (`cmlfnhzjfhuynzuleyxt`) SQL editor:

1. Paste full contents of [`apps/chg/scripts/security-hotfix-handle-new-user.sql`](../../apps/chg/scripts/security-hotfix-handle-new-user.sql) and run. Should return "Success. No rows returned." in <1s.
2. Paste full contents of [`apps/chg/scripts/phase-1-product-migration.sql`](../../apps/chg/scripts/phase-1-product-migration.sql) and run. Should return "Success. No rows returned." in <10s. Watch for any error — if you see one, STOP and paste the error to Claude.

### Step A3 — Verify on staging

Paste each query from [`apps/chg/scripts/phase-1-product-migration-verify.sql`](../../apps/chg/scripts/phase-1-product-migration-verify.sql) one at a time. Each is labeled with the PASS criteria. If any query returns unexpected results, STOP.

If all checks pass, staging rehearsal is a success.

### Step A4 — (Optional) test rollback on staging

To verify the rollback script works: paste [`apps/chg/scripts/phase-1-product-migration-rollback.sql`](../../apps/chg/scripts/phase-1-product-migration-rollback.sql) and run. Re-run the forward migration afterwards to restore the staging state.

## Phase B — Prod deploy

### Step B1 — Take a fresh backup snapshot

**In the Supabase dashboard for prod:**

1. Database → Backups → **Create a new backup** (label: `pre-phase-1-prod`)
2. Wait for completion
3. Note the backup timestamp — this is your PITR restore target if anything goes wrong

### Step B2 — Deploy the security hotfix trigger (if not already)

If the trigger fix hasn't been applied to prod yet:

1. **Prod** SQL editor
2. Paste [`security-hotfix-handle-new-user.sql`](../../apps/chg/scripts/security-hotfix-handle-new-user.sql)
3. Run. Expect <1s.
4. Verify with: `SELECT pg_get_functiondef(oid) FROM pg_proc WHERE proname = 'handle_new_user';` — body should match the new version.

### Step B3 — Deploy the product migration

1. **Prod** SQL editor
2. Paste [`phase-1-product-migration.sql`](../../apps/chg/scripts/phase-1-product-migration.sql)
3. Run. Expect <10s.
4. If ANY error appears: **DO NOT re-run**. Paste the error to Claude. Claude will decide whether to retry, rollback, or PITR.

### Step B4 — Verify prod

Run each query from [`phase-1-product-migration-verify.sql`](../../apps/chg/scripts/phase-1-product-migration-verify.sql). Every check should PASS.

### Step B5 — Smoke test the live app

1. Open the OLD CHG Replit (`chg-crm.replit.app`) and log in as an existing user
2. Check: dashboard loads, properties list loads, construction list loads
3. Check: nothing is visibly broken

Phase 1 kept all old columns intact, so the running app should be completely unaffected. This smoke test is a sanity check that RLS didn't accidentally tighten.

### Step B6 — Re-enable new signups

Go to Supabase Auth → Sign In / Providers → toggle **"Allow new users to sign up" back ON**.

Why it's safe now: the `handle_new_user()` trigger is fixed (step B2) — new signups via the public endpoint create bare profiles with no account/role, which `requireAuth` rejects. The server's own `/api/auth/signup` path continues to work exactly as before.

## Rollback decision tree

**If something goes wrong after Step B3 (prod migration)**, the rollback path depends on what broke.

| Symptom | Root cause likely | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Migration SQL errored mid-run | DDL conflict, transient Supabase issue | Transaction rolled back automatically. State unchanged. Report error to Claude, retry after fix. |
| Migration succeeded but verify queries fail | Logic bug in migration or backfill | Run `phase-1-product-migration-rollback.sql`. Report which verify query failed to Claude. |
| Live CHG app breaks (5xx errors, data missing) | RLS policy regression or column drop | **STOP. Immediately PITR restore to `pre-phase-1-prod` backup.** Do NOT try to patch forward. |
| Customer reports data showing across accounts | Tenant isolation broke | **STOP. PITR immediately.** This is the handoff's HIGH risk scenario. |

**PITR restore path** (only if serious issue):
1. Supabase dashboard for prod → Database → Backups
2. Find `pre-phase-1-prod` backup from Step B1
3. Click "Restore" — this creates a parallel database; Supabase guides the cutover
4. Notify CHG customers of brief outage
5. Claude + Nicole regroup before retrying

## Post-migration cleanup (Phase 2 territory)

After Phase 1 is stable and Phase 2 middleware updates land, a later SQL pass will:
- Drop `accounts.plan_tier`, `accounts.allowed_departments`, `accounts.max_users`
- Collapse `construction_phases.material_budget` ↔ `materials_budget` to one column
- Add missing columns from schema.sql (`tenants.current_late_fee`, `properties.monthly_rent`) IF actually used in client code

These are explicitly OUT OF SCOPE for Phase 1 to keep blast radius minimal.
